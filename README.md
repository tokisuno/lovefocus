# Pomodoro Timer in LÃ–VE2D
## Purpose?
I was bored and wanted to learn how to use love2d. That's it. I also haven't touched the code for my timer in Raylib in a while and I don't really use C, so I wanted to see how I could do the same thing with lua instead.

## Functionality
- Study timer
- Break timer
- Fun sound effects

# Checklist
- [x] Sound effects
- [x] Accept change state (C-y)
- [ ] Have a sprite for studying and a sprite for break time
- [ ] Go back a session in case of mistake
- [ ] Keymap to increment sessions (C-n/C-p)

## Maybe?
- [ ] Config file (???)
- [ ] Start today's sessions
- [ ] Render image of "never give up" guy

# States
1. Time to study!
2. Study session
3. Time for break!
4. Break time

... Repeat until done
